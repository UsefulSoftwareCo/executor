/**
 * The E2E runner's two process hooks, active only when `EXECUTOR_ENVIRONMENT=e2e` asks for them.
 * A release executable runs no preload, so the runner cannot inject these from outside; source
 * runs use the same code, so every run exercises one entry point. Import this module first.
 *
 * - `EXECUTOR_TEST_CLOCK_OFFSET_MS` moves wall time forward by up to 40 days, past the 30-day
 *   refresh token lifetime and idle grant expiry, and `EXECUTOR_TEST_CLOCK_CONTROL=stdin` lets the
 *   runner move it further while the process runs. Timers and monotonic durations are unchanged.
 * - `EXECUTOR_TEST_STOP_FD=3` stops the process when the runner writes to its private fd3 pipe.
 *   Only this process holds the pipe's reading end, so a request reaches it or nothing: after it
 *   exits, the runner's write fails instead of signalling whatever process reuses its PID.
 *
 * Neither hook runs code from outside the process.
